## 📞 Need Help?

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue:** "I don't know where to start"
**Solution:** Start with QUICK_START.md, implement the service layer first

**Issue:** "This seems overwhelming"
**Solution:** Take it one commit at a time. You don't have to do everything at once

**Issue:** "I'm stuck on implementing X"
**Solution:** Refer to Laravel documentation, search GitHub for similar implementations

**Issue:** "Should I upgrade Laravel version?"
**Solution:** Optional, but recommended. Laravel 10 has better features
